    <h1>Banana Bread Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../images/bananabreadpancakes.jpg" width="400" height="300">
    <h3>If you're a fan of our banana bread, then you're gonna love this, since it's based on that recipe. As easy as that is to make, these are even easier. I really think that this threads the needle between something that has the flavor of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. Top with butter and banana slices and serve with warm maple syrup.</h3>
        <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>flour</li>
                <li>banana</li>
                <li>baking soda/powder</li>
                <li>sugar</li>
                <li>banana</li>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>eggs</li>
            </ul>
        
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed</li>
                <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined. </li> 
                <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>

            </ol>
